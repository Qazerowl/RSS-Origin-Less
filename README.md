This is a mod for Kerbal Space Program.

This is a paried down version of the mod [RSS-Origin CelestialsPack](https://github.com/CharonSSS/RSS-Origin/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#rss-origin-celestialspack).

Original RSS (no origin) contains 33 bodies.
Adding RSS-Origin-Less-Primary brings that to a total of 59
Adding both Primary and Secondary brings that total to 111
If that's not enough for you, install the original project instead of this for a total of 231.

Primary adds about 2 moons to each gas giant, 4 dwarf planets out by Pluto, and 5 more asteroids to the asteroid belt. (And the moons of any included objects). Selections mostly based on just picking the largest objects from each category.

Secondary includes 1-3 more moons to each gas giant, 2 additional moons for Pluto, 6 more asteroid belt asteroids, the two biggest near earth asteroids, the two largest Jupiter trojans, 4 centaurs, and 12 additional dwarf planets / TNOs further out than Neptune. (And the moons of any included objects). Selections mostly based on just picking the largest objects from each category.

And just to reiterate: all this is is CharonSSS/RSS-Origin with a bunch of bodies removed for convenience.
